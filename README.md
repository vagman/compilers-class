## Compilers Class
* Five assignments based on lex (regular expressions) and how they work. Here are three of them.
* Coworkers: Nick Tigkilis.
* I used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Lex plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=faustinoaq.lex-flex-yacc-bison) in Linux (Ubuntu).
* **Note:** The proffessor does not accept hand-written notes (even if scanned). Also, any kind of spelling mistakes are prohibited. Any of the above will be deducted from your assignment's grade.
